# Reasoning Strategies Guide

This document explains the reasoning strategies available in the base agent and when to use each one.

## Overview

The base agent supports multiple reasoning strategies that can be switched at runtime. Each strategy has different strengths and is optimized for different types of tasks.

## Available Strategies

### 1. ReAct (Reason + Act) [DEFAULT]

**Pattern:** Iterative reasoning with tool use

**How it works:**
1. Agent thinks about what to do
2. Agent acts (uses tools or responds)
3. Agent observes results
4. Repeat until done

**Best for:**
- General-purpose tasks
- Exploratory problem-solving
- Tasks where next steps depend on results
- Unknown complexity

**Performance:**
- Speed: Fast âš¡âš¡âš¡
- Quality: Good âœ“âœ“âœ“
- Token usage: Low ðŸ’°
- Reliability: Very High âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“

**Configuration:**
- `max_iterations`: Maximum reasoning cycles (default: 20)

**Example use cases:**
- General Q&A
- Debug a specific error
- Research a topic with follow-up questions
- File operations and system tasks

---

### 2. ReWOO (Reasoning Without Observation)

**Pattern:** Plan everything upfront, execute in parallel

**How it works:**
1. Create complete plan of all steps
2. Execute all tool calls in parallel
3. Synthesize results into final answer

**Best for:**
- Research tasks with multiple queries
- Data gathering from multiple sources
- Predictable workflows
- Tasks where steps don't depend on each other

**Performance:**
- Speed: Very Fast âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡ (parallel execution)
- Quality: Good âœ“âœ“âœ“
- Token usage: Low ðŸ’°
- Reliability: Medium âœ“âœ“ (can't adapt to unexpected results)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot adapt plan based on results
- Requires clear problem structure
- Less effective for exploratory tasks

**Example use cases:**
- "Compare Python vs JavaScript for web development"
- "Gather information about top 5 AI companies"
- Multi-source research projects
- Batch operations

### 3. Plan-and-Execute

**Pattern:** Adaptive planning with sequential execution

**How it works:**
1. Create high-level plan
2. Execute steps sequentially
3. Check progress after each step
4. Replan if needed
5. Continue until goal achieved

**Best for:**
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Tasks requiring adaptive planning
- Projects needing decomposition
- Progress tracking matters

**Performance:**
- Speed: Medium âš¡âš¡
- Quality: Very Good âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“
- Token usage: Medium ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
- Reliability: High âœ“âœ“âœ“

**Configuration:**
- `max_replans`: Maximum number of times to replan (default: 3)

**Limitations:**
- Slower than ReAct (more LLM calls)
- Can get stuck in planning loops
- Overkill for simple tasks

**Example use cases:**
- "Build a complete REST API with tests"
- "Refactor this codebase following SOLID principles"
- Project setup with multiple components
- Complex debugging requiring investigation

---

### 4. LATS (Language Agent Tree Search)

**Pattern:** Tree search with self-reflection

**How it works:**
1. Generate multiple candidate approaches
2. Reflect on and evaluate each candidate
3. Select best approach
4. Execute and repeat if needed

**Best for:**
- Complex algorithmic problems
- Code optimization tasks
- Problems with multiple valid approaches
- When quality matters more than speed

**Performance:**
- Speed: Slow âš¡ (many LLM calls)
- Quality: Excellent âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“
- Token usage: High ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
- Reliability: Very High âœ“âœ“âœ“âœ“

**Configuration:**
- `num_candidates`: Alternatives to consider at each step (default: 3)
- `max_depth`: Maximum search depth (default: 5)
- `enable_reflection`: Whether to use self-reflection (default: true)

**Limitations:**
- Much slower than other strategies
- Higher token/cost usage
- Overkill for simple tasks

**Example use cases:**
- "Optimize this sorting algorithm"
- "Find the best architecture for this system"
- Complex coding challenges
- HumanEval-style problems

## Choosing the Right Strategy

### Decision Tree

```
Is it a simple, general task?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Use ReAct (default)
â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue

Does it involve multiple independent searches/queries?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Use ReWOO (parallel speedup)
â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue

Is it a complex multi-step task requiring planning?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Use Plan-and-Execute
â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue

Do you need the absolute best solution?
â””â”€ YES â†’ Use LATS (accept slower speed)
```

## Strategy Indicators

When the agent is thinking, you'll see the active strategy in the status message:

```
[REACT] Thinking...
[REWOO] Thinking...
[PLAN-EXECUTE] Thinking...
[LATS] Thinking...
```

## Extending with Custom Strategies

To create a custom reasoning strategy:

1. Create a new file in `src/reasoning/strategies/`
2. Inherit from `ReasoningStrategy` base class
3. Implement required methods:
   - `create_graph()`: Build your LangGraph
   - `get_name()`: Return strategy identifier
   - `get_description()`: Return human-readable description
4. Register in `strategy_registry.py`

Example:
```python
from .base import ReasoningStrategy

class MyCustomStrategy(ReasoningStrategy):
    def get_name(self) -> str:
        return "custom"

    def get_description(self) -> str:
        return "My custom reasoning approach"

    def create_graph(self, agent_state_class, llm_with_tools, tools):
        # Build your custom LangGraph here
        pass
```

## Performance Benchmarks

## Troubleshooting

**Strategy switch not working?**
- Check that you're using a valid strategy name (lowercase, hyphenated)
- Try `/reasoning list` to see available strategies

**Agent not behaving as expected?**
- Try switching to ReAct (most reliable)
- Check `/reasoning current` to confirm active strategy
- Use `/reasoning info` to see strategy configuration

**Too slow with LATS?**
- This is expected - LATS explores multiple paths
- Consider switching to Plan-and-Execute for similar quality, better speed
- Or use ReAct for simple tasks

**ReWOO failing on complex tasks?**
- ReWOO can't adapt its plan mid-execution
- Try Plan-and-Execute instead for adaptive planning
