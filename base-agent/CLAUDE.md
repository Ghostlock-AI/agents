# Base Agent

A foundational AI agent framework built with LangGraph, designed to serve as the basis for specialized agent systems with advanced reasoning, tool use, and memory capabilities.

## Current State (Phase 2 - Advanced Reasoning Complete)

### âœ… Implemented Features

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **Multiple Reasoning Strategies**: ReAct, ReWOO, Plan-and-Execute, LATS with runtime switching
- **Strategy Registry**: Centralized management and dynamic strategy loading
- **Multi-LLM Support**: OpenAI integration (Anthropic & local models coming)
- **Tool System**: DuckDuckGo search, web fetch, and shell execution with safety guardrails
- **Session Memory**: Conversation context maintained via LangGraph's MemorySaver
- **Enhanced CLI Interface**: TUI with reasoning strategy commands and visualization
- **Tool Visibility**: `[TOOL: name]` notifications show when agent uses tools
- **Strategy Indicators**: Shows active strategy in status messages

**Reasoning Strategies:**
- **ReAct**: Iterative reasoning with tool use (default, most reliable)
- **ReWOO**: Upfront planning with parallel execution (fastest for research)
- **Plan-and-Execute**: Adaptive planning with replanning (best for complex tasks)
- **LATS**: Tree search with self-reflection (highest quality, slower)

**Architecture:**
- Modular design with strategy pattern: `reasoning/strategies/`, `strategy_registry.py`
- Base strategy interface with extensibility support
- Runtime strategy switching without restart
- Strategy-specific configuration and tracing
- External system prompt loaded from file
- Environment-based configuration (.env)
- Type-safe state management with Pydantic

### ðŸš§ Current Limitations

- No file context management yet
- No long-term memory (ChromaDB not integrated)
- Limited to OpenAI models (multi-provider coming)
- No session persistence to disk
- No sub-agent support (orchestrator-worker pattern coming)
- LATS is simplified version (full MCTS coming)

### Phase 3: Memory & Learning

**ChromaDB Integration**
- Persistent vector storage for task patterns
- Semantic search over past solutions
- Success/failure case library
- Code snippet retrieval

**Task Pattern Extraction**
- Automatic learning from successful executions
- Pattern recognition across tasks
- Complexity classification (simple/medium/complex)
- Tool usage pattern analysis

**Enrichment Retrieval System**
- Top-K similar task retrieval
- Solution scaffolds (step-by-step approaches)
- Error correction patterns
- Domain-specific enrichments

**Task Memory Tree (TMT)**
- Hierarchical task tracking
- State per node: pending/in_progress/completed/failed
- Learning extraction from execution paths
- Solves "dementia problem" - agent learns from experience

---

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**
- Lead agent (Opus 4 / GPT-4) for planning
- Worker agents (Sonnet 4.5 / GPT-4o-mini) for execution
- 15x token usage, 90% better results (Anthropic's findings)
- 90% time reduction on complex queries

**Parallel Sub-Agent Execution**
- Spawn 5-10 workers simultaneously
- Each with isolated context
- Specialized tool subsets per worker
- Concurrent task execution

**Result Aggregation**
- Structured output collection
- Conflict resolution
- Synthesis into coherent response
- Quality scoring

**Automatic Sub-Agent Selection**
- Task-to-agent matching
- Capability-based routing
- Load balancing
- Fallback strategies

---

### Phase 5: Optimization & Production

**KV-Cache Optimization**
- Stable prompt prefixes (80% performance gain)
- Append-only context strategy
- Progressive disclosure vs front-loading
- Cache hit rate monitoring (target: >70%)

**Context Compression**
- Token-efficient tool descriptions (dynamic loading)
- File summarization for unchanged content
- Smart retrieval (load only relevant sections)
- Emergency context offloading to sub-agents

**Specialized Sub-Agents**
- `code-reviewer`: Static analysis, pattern matching
- `test-generator`: Test creation & execution
- `security-analyzer`: Vulnerability scanning
- `documentation-writer`: Doc generation & validation
- `refactoring-specialist`: AST-based transformations

**Cost Tracking & Controls**
- Token usage per task
- Model selection optimization (10x cost reduction via workers)
- Budget limits & alerts
- Cache savings metrics (target: 50% reduction)

2. **Tool-Creating Agent**: WebAssembly sandboxing, test-driven tool generation
3. **Red-Teaming Agent**: Attack patterns (MITRE ATT&CK), fuzzing, security metrics
